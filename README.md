# Tic-tac-toe
This PYTHON program plays the game of TIC-TAC-TOE on a 
3Ã—3 board with alternate inputs from user and computer.

The user is prompted for choosing letter X or O. 

It will be chosen randomly whether the user makes the first move or the computer in 
the first round. From subsequent rounds, user and computer will alternatively make 
first move. 

A sleep time of 1 sec is set while the computer makes its move. 

There are two difficulty levels for the user: EASY (Enter 0) and HARD (Enter 1). 

In Easy mode, the computer makes moves randomly while in Hard mode, it uses the 
MiniMax algorithm.

The board positions are numbered from 1 to 9. The board position numbering can be 
seen by pressing 0.
